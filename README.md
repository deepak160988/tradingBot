------> What i Have Done <------
I can help you set up a simple Python Flask application that will act as the backend for receiving TradingView alerts and forwarding them to your Telegram bot.

Important Note: This Python application needs to run on a server that is publicly accessible from the internet for TradingView to send webhooks to it. Your local computer can work for testing, but for continuous operation, you'll need to deploy it to a cloud platform.

Here's how to set up the backend:

Step 1: Prerequisites - Install Python and pip
If you don't have Python installed, download it from python.org. Python 3.8+ is recommended. pip (Python's package installer) usually comes with Python.

Step 2: Create Your Project Directory
Create a new folder for your project, navigate into it, and create two files: app.py and requirements.txt.

Bash

mkdir tradingview-telegram-bot
cd tradingview-telegram-bot
touch app.py requirements.txt
Step 3: Get Your Telegram Bot Token and Chat ID
As mentioned before, you'll need these:

Bot Token: From @BotFather on Telegram, create a new bot and copy the API token. It looks something like 1234567890:ABCDEFGHIJKLMN_OPQRSTUVWXYZ-ABCDEFGH.
Chat ID:
Start a conversation with your new bot (send it any message).
Open https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_API_TOKEN>/getUpdates in your web browser, replacing <YOUR_BOT_API_TOKEN> with your actual bot token.
Look for the id under "chat": in the JSON response. It will be a number (e.g., -123456789 for a group chat or 123456789 for a private chat).
Step 4: Write the requirements.txt File
This file lists the Python libraries your application needs.

Open

Step 5: Write the app.py File
This is the main Python code for your server.
app.py (TradingView Telegram Bot Backend)
18 Jun, 00:15

Open

Step 6: Create a .env File (Crucial for Security)
In the same tradingview-telegram-bot directory, create a file named .env (note the dot at the beginning). This file will store your sensitive credentials securely.
.env file

Open

Step 7: Install Dependencies
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your tradingview-telegram-bot directory, and run:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install Flask, Requests, and python-dotenv.

Step 8: Run the Flask Application Locally
In your terminal, from the tradingview-telegram-bot directory, run:

Bash

python app.py
You should see output similar to this:

 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: ...
Your server is now running locally on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or http://localhost:5000). The webhook endpoint will be http://127.0.0.1:5000/tradingview-alert.

Step 9: Testing Locally (Optional but Recommended)
You can test if your local server is working by sending a POST request to it. You'll need a tool like curl (available on Linux/macOS, or you can install it on Windows), or a browser extension like "Thunder Client" (for VS Code) or "Postman".

Using curl:

Open a new terminal window (keep your Flask app running in the first one) and run:

Bash

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"strategy_name": "Test Strategy", "ticker": "BTCUSD", "interval": "1h", "action": "Test Buy", "price": 60000.00, "volume": 1.0, "time": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/tradingview-alert
If successful, you should see a message in your Telegram chat, and your Flask terminal should show logs of receiving and processing the alert.

Step 10: Deploy Your Application (For Public Access)
Since TradingView needs to access your webhook URL, your Flask application must be publicly available. You cannot use http://127.0.0.1:5000 directly.

Common deployment options include:

Heroku (Simple PaaS): Good for quick deployments. You'd set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID as "Config Vars."
Vercel / Render / Netlify: Can host serverless functions (e.g., Python functions) or full web services.
AWS EC2 / Google Cloud Compute Engine / Azure VM: For more control, but requires more setup (setting up a web server like Nginx, WSGI server like Gunicorn).
Google Cloud Run: A good serverless option for containerized applications.
When deploying, make sure to set your TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID as environment variables on your chosen platform, as they are crucial for security.

Step 11: Configure TradingView Alert Webhook
Once your application is deployed and has a public HTTPS URL (e.g., https://your-app-domain.com/tradingview-alert), you can configure your TradingView alerts:

In TradingView, create or edit an alert.
Go to the "Notifications" tab.
Check the "Webhook URL" box.
Enter your deployed application's webhook URL (e.g., https://your-app-domain.com/tradingview-alert).
In the "Message" box (below the "Webhook URL" field), paste the JSON payload example (or customize it further):
JSON

{
  "strategy_name": "{{strategy.name}}",
  "ticker": "{{ticker}}",
  "interval": "{{interval}}",
  "action": "{{strategy.order.action}}",
  "price": "{{close}}",
  "volume": "{{volume}}",
  "time": "{{time}}"
}
This JSON will be sent as the body of the POST request to your Flask application, and your Flask app will parse it.
This setup provides a robust and secure way to connect your TradingView alerts to your Telegram bot.





withour coding for free



Show thinking
It's understandable that you'd want to achieve this without diving into coding, and ideally for free! Directly connecting TradingView alerts to your Telegram bot without any custom code is tricky because TradingView's webhook feature requires a server endpoint to receive the alert data. Your current HTML app runs entirely in your browser and cannot act as this server.

However, there are "no-code" or "low-code" integration platforms that can serve as intermediaries. Many of these offer free tiers for basic usage.

Here are the most popular options and how you'd generally set them up:

No-Code/Low-Code Integration Platforms:
Zapier (Popular Choice):

Concept: "When X happens (TradingView alert), do Y (send Telegram message)."
Free Tier: Offers limited "Zaps" (automations) and "Tasks" (executions per month). Might be enough for low-volume alerts.
How it works:
Trigger (TradingView): You'd set up a "Webhook by Zapier" as the trigger. Zapier gives you a unique URL.
Action (Telegram): You'd then configure an action to "Send Message in Telegram." You'll connect your Telegram bot (using its API token) and specify the chat ID.
Setup Steps:
Create a Zapier account.
Create a new Zap.
Choose "Webhooks by Zapier" as the trigger app, and "Catch Hook" as the trigger event. Copy the provided webhook URL.
In TradingView, create/edit your alert. Under "Notifications," check "Webhook URL" and paste the Zapier URL. In the "Message" box, you can send plain text or JSON (Zapier can parse both).
Test the webhook from TradingView (by triggering an alert or sending a test message). Zapier will "catch" this.
Add an Action step: Choose "Telegram Bot" as the action app, and "Send Message" as the action event.
Connect your Telegram bot using its API token. Select your chat ID.
Map the data received from TradingView (e.g., {{payload_text}} if you sent plain text, or specific JSON fields) to the Telegram message content.
Turn your Zap on.
Make.com (formerly Integromat):

Concept: Similar to Zapier, but often offers more complex logic and higher limits on its free tier, making it a powerful alternative.
Free Tier: Provides a generous number of "Operations" (equivalent to Zapier's tasks) per month.
How it works: You build "scenarios" by dragging and dropping modules.
Setup Steps:
Create a Make.com account.
Create a new Scenario.
Add a module for "Webhooks." Create a custom webhook and copy its address.
Configure your TradingView alert's Webhook URL to this Make.com URL.
Test the webhook from TradingView. Make.com will capture the incoming data.
Add another module for "Telegram Bot." Choose "Send a Message."
Connect your Telegram bot token.
Map the data received from the webhook module to the Telegram message text.
Save and activate your Scenario.
General Considerations for Free Tiers:
Usage Limits: Free plans typically have limitations on how many "tasks" or "operations" you can perform per month. If you have many TradingView alerts or they trigger frequently, you might hit these limits quickly.
Execution Frequency: Some free tiers might only check for new webhooks every few minutes, which could introduce a slight delay in receiving alerts.
Feature Limitations: Advanced features (like multiple steps in a workflow, premium app integrations, or higher data volume) are usually reserved for paid plans.
While these platforms allow you to achieve the integration "without coding" in the traditional sense, they do involve a configuration process using their visual interfaces. For very high volume or mission-critical alerts, a custom backend application (like the Python Flask app I previously described) deployed on a cloud service offers more control, scalability, and potentially lower cost in the long run, but it requires initial coding and deployment expertise.






How to get Chat ID of a bot and



Show thinking
You're looking for the Chat ID of your Telegram bot, which is essential for your bot to know where to send messages. There are a couple of straightforward ways to get it:

Method 1: Using the Telegram Bot API getUpdates method (Recommended)
This is the most common and reliable method.

Create your Telegram Bot (if you haven't already):

Open Telegram and search for @BotFather.
Start a chat with BotFather and send the command /newbot.
Follow the prompts to choose a name and a username for your bot.
Once created, BotFather will give you an API Token. It looks like a long string of numbers and letters, separated by a colon (e.g., 1234567890:ABCDEFGHIJKLMN_OPQRSTUVWXYZ-ABCDEFGH). Keep this token secret!
Start a conversation with your new bot:

Search for your bot's username in Telegram.
Open a chat with your bot and send it any message. This could be "Hi," "/start," or just a random string. This step is crucial because the getUpdates method only returns information for chats where the bot has received a message.
Use your web browser to get updates:

Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

In the address bar, type the following URL, replacing <YOUR_BOT_API_TOKEN> with the actual token you got from BotFather:

https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_API_TOKEN>/getUpdates
Example: https://api.telegram.org/bot1234567890:ABCDEFGHIJKLMN_OPQRSTUVWXYZ-ABCDEFGH/getUpdates

Find the chat ID in the JSON response:

After pressing Enter, you'll see a page with a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) response.

Look for an object that looks something like this:

JSON

{
  "ok": true,
  "result": [
    {
      "update_id": 123456789,
      "message": {
        "message_id": 1,
        "from": {
          "id": 987654321,
          "is_bot": false,
          "first_name": "Your",
          "last_name": "Name",
          "username": "YourUsername",
          "language_code": "en"
        },
        "chat": {
          "id": 123456789,   <-- THIS IS YOUR CHAT ID!
          "first_name": "Your",
          "last_name": "Name",
          "username": "YourUsername",
          "type": "private"
        },
        "date": 1678886400,
        "text": "Hi bot!"
      }
    }
  ]
}
The id field inside the "chat": {} object is your Chat ID. In the example above, it's 123456789.

For Group Chats: If you add your bot to a group and send a message in the group, the chat.id for a group will typically start with a negative sign (e.g., -1234567890). Make sure to include the negative sign if it's there!

Method 2: Using a dedicated Telegram Bot (e.g., @RawDataBot or @myidbot)
There are bots specifically designed to tell you your chat ID.

Search for the bot:
Open Telegram and search for @RawDataBot or @myidbot.
Start a chat:
Tap on the bot's name and then tap "Start."
Receive your ID:
The bot will immediately send you a message containing various pieces of information, including your chat ID. Look for a line that clearly states ID or chat ID.
This method is quicker if you just need your personal chat ID or a group chat ID (after adding the bot to the group).

Once you have your Chat ID, you can use it in your backend application or no-code platform to send messages to that specific chat or group!

No Chat ID for my telegram bot after entering getupdates



Show thinking
It's frustrating when getUpdates returns an empty result array! This is a very common issue, and it usually means one of a few things. Let's troubleshoot it step-by-step:

Here are the most common reasons why getUpdates might return {"ok":true,"result":[]} and how to fix them:

1. You Haven't Sent Any Message to the Bot (or in the group with the bot)
The getUpdates method retrieves messages that your bot has received. If your bot hasn't received any messages yet, there's nothing to return, so the result array will be empty.

How to Fix:

For a private chat with your bot:

Open Telegram.
Search for your bot by its @username (the one you set up with BotFather, ending in _bot).
Tap on your bot to open a chat.
Send any message to your bot. Even a simple "Hi" or "/start" will work.
Now, try opening https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_API_TOKEN>/getUpdates in your browser again. You should see the message you just sent, and within that, the chat.id.
For a group chat:

Add your bot to the group.
Crucially, send a message in the group after the bot has been added. You can simply type "test" or mention the bot (e.g., @YourBotName).
Go back to your browser and refresh the getUpdates URL. The chat.id for the group should now appear in the JSON response, usually starting with a negative sign (e.g., -1234567890).
2. Your Bot Has Privacy Mode Enabled (for group chats)
By default, when you create a bot, its "Privacy Mode" in groups is often enabled. This means the bot will only receive messages that are:

Explicitly commands (e.g., /mycommand@YourBotName).
Replies to one of its own messages.
Messages sent directly to the bot via its username (e.g., "Hello @YourBotName").
It will not see all general messages in the group. If you want it to see all messages (which you usually do for a journaling bot or alert system), you need to disable Privacy Mode.

How to Fix:

Open Telegram and go to @BotFather.
Send the command /mybots.
Select the bot you're having trouble with.
Tap on "Bot Settings".
Tap on "Group Privacy".
Tap "Turn off" (or similar option to disable privacy mode).
After turning off privacy mode, send another message in your group chat and then try getUpdates again.

3. A Webhook is Active
If you've previously set up a webhook for your bot (perhaps for another project or if you experimented with a "no-code" platform that uses webhooks), the getUpdates method will not work. Telegram's Bot API only allows one method of receiving updates at a time: either getUpdates (long polling) or Webhooks. If a webhook is active, Telegram will send updates to that URL and won't make them available via getUpdates.

How to Fix:

Check if a webhook is active:
Open your web browser and go to:
https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_API_TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo
Look for the "url" field in the JSON response.
If it's empty ("url": ""), no webhook is set.
If it contains a URL (e.g., "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook"), then a webhook is active.
Delete the active webhook:
If a webhook is active, you need to delete it. Open your web browser and go to:
https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_API_TOKEN>/deleteWebhook
You should get a response like {"ok":true,"result":true,"description":"Webhook was deleted"}.
Now, try https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_API_TOKEN>/getUpdates again after sending a new message to your bot.
4. Incorrect Bot Token
Double-check that you've correctly copied your bot token into the getUpdates URL. Even a single character error will cause the API call to fail or return an empty result. Ensure there are no extra spaces.

Summary of what to do:
ALWAYS send a message to your bot (or in the group where your bot is) before trying getUpdates.
If it's a group, disable "Group Privacy" for your bot via @BotFather.
Check for and delete any active webhooks using getWebhookInfo and deleteWebhook.
Verify your bot token is correct.
Try these steps, and you should be able to retrieve your chat ID!







Deploy Your Application (For Public Access) using render



Show thinking
To deploy your Python Flask application to Render for public access, you'll need to use Git (like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) to host your code. Render integrates directly with these Git repositories, making deployment very smooth.

Render is an excellent choice for this kind of application because it provides free tiers for web services, automatically handles HTTPS, and makes deployment relatively simple.

Prerequisites:
Before you start, ensure you have:

Your Flask application files:

app.py (your Flask code)
requirements.txt (listing Flask, requests, python-dotenv)
Crucially, do NOT commit your .env file to Git. This file contains your sensitive TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID. Instead, you'll add these as environment variables directly in Render.
A Git Repository:

Initialize a Git repository in your project folder.
Commit app.py and requirements.txt to it.
Add .env to your .gitignore file before committing, to prevent it from being uploaded.
Example Git commands:

Bash

cd tradingview-telegram-bot # Your project folder
git init
echo ".env" >> .gitignore # Add .env to .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git add app.py requirements.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit for TradingView Telegram Bot"
git branch -M main # Rename default branch to 'main'
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git # Replace with your repo URL
git push -u origin main
Make sure your repository is public or you connect Render with appropriate permissions for private repos.

Step-by-Step Deployment on Render:
Step 1: Sign up for Render
Go to https://render.com/ and sign up. You can usually sign up using your GitHub account for easier integration.
Step 2: Connect Your Git Repository to Render
After signing in, click on "New" in the dashboard.
Select "Web Service".
Choose your Git provider (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). You might need to authorize Render to access your repositories.
Select the repository where you pushed your tradingview-telegram-bot code. If you don't see it, click "Configure account" to grant Render access to more repositories.
Step 3: Configure Your Web Service
Now you'll configure the details for your Flask application:

Name: Give your service a memorable name (e.g., tradingview-telegram-bot, my-trade-alerts). This will be part of your public URL.

Region: Choose a region closest to you or your users for better performance.

Branch: Select the branch where your code resides (e.g., main).

Root Directory: If your app.py and requirements.txt are in the root of your repository, leave this blank. If they are in a subfolder (e.g., src/), specify that folder (e.g., src).

Runtime: Select Python 3.

Build Command: This command tells Render how to install your project dependencies. Enter:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Command: This command tells Render how to run your Flask application. You should use a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn. Enter:

Bash

gunicorn app:app
gunicorn is the server.
app:app tells Gunicorn to find the Flask application instance named app within the app.py file.
Instance Type: Select Free. (Note: Free instances spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity and may have slow cold starts. For continuous, faster operation, you'd need a paid plan.)

Step 4: Add Environment Variables
This is where you securely add your TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID.

Scroll down to the "Environment Variables" section.

Click "Add Environment Variable".

Key: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
Value: Paste your actual Telegram Bot API Token here.
Click "Add Environment Variable" again.

Key: TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
Value: Paste your actual Telegram Chat ID here.
Important: Do NOT hardcode these values in your app.py file when deploying. Using environment variables is the secure and recommended practice. Your app.py already uses os.getenv to read these, which is perfect.

Step 5: Create the Web Service
Click the "Create Web Service" button at the bottom of the page.
Render will now start building and deploying your application. You can watch the build logs in real-time on your Render dashboard. This process might take a few minutes for the first deployment.

Step 6: Get Your Public URL
Once the deployment is successful, Render will provide you with a public URL for your web service (e.g., https://your-service-name.onrender.com/).

Your webhook endpoint will be https://your-service-name.onrender.com/tradingview-alert.
Step 7: Update TradingView Alert
Finally, go back to TradingView:

Edit your alert settings.
In the "Notifications" tab, check "Webhook URL".
Paste your new Render URL: https://your-service-name.onrender.com/tradingview-alert.
Ensure your "Message" content is in JSON format, as discussed previously, so your Flask app can parse it (e.g., {"ticker": "{{ticker}}", "price": "{{close}}", ...}).
Save the alert.
Now, when your TradingView alert triggers, it will send a webhook to your deployed Flask application on Render, which will then forward the message to your Telegram bot!
